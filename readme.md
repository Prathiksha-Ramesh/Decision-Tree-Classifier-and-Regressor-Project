# Decision Tree Classifier and Regressor Project

## Description

This project involves implementing and evaluating the Decision Tree algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees are a popular, interpretable, and versatile machine learning model used for various tasks such as classification and regression. This project demonstrates the application of Decision Trees to different datasets, analyzes its performance, and compares it to other machine learning models.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries, as listed in the requirements.txt file:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
These libraries are essential for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

## Data Overview
The project utilizes the Iris dataset to demonstrate the application of Decision Trees in classification:

- Iris Dataset: The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples each from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. The task is to predict the species of an iris flower based on these features.
Both datasets are preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and split into training and testing sets.

## Notebook Structure
The Jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb is structured as follows:

1. Introduction:

- Overview of the Decision Tree algorithm, including its advantages, limitations, and applications in classification and regression.

2.Data Loading and Preprocessing

3. Implementation of the Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn.

- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search to find the optimal parameters like max depth, min samples split, etc.
- Evaluation of the classifier using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

4. Decision Tree Regressor Implementation:

- Implementation of the Decision Tree regressor using scikit-learn.
- Hyperparameter tuning to determine the best parameters for regression.

5. Post-pruning:

- Application of post-pruning techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

6. Pre-pruning and Hyperparameter Tuning:

- Application of pre-pruning techniques such as limiting the tree depth and minimum samples required for a split.

7. Comparison with Other Models:

- Comparison of Decision Tree's performance with other machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Linear Regression for both classification and regression tasks.

8. Results and Discussion:

- Visualization of the results using plots and graphs.
- Discussion on how different hyperparameters impact model performance.
